## Teaching

If you are looking for our regular database group meetings and talks, they are under [CSE 591D](http://www.cs.washington.edu/education/courses/591d/)

[The database reading seminar is CSE590Q.](http://www.cs.washington.edu/education/courses/590q)

I regularly teach the following courses:

* [DATA516/CSED516](https://courses.cs.washington.edu/courses/csed516/): Scalable Data Systems and Algorithms

* [CSE444](http://www.cs.washington.edu/education/courses/444/): Database Systems Internals

In the past, I also taught:
