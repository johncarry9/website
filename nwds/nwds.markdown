<p><strong>Title</strong>:
    Enabling Emerging Edge and IoT Applications with Edge-Cloud Data Management
</p>

<p><strong>Abstract</strong>:
The potential of Edge and IoT applications encompasses realms like smart cities, mobility solutions, and immersive technologies. Yet, the actualization of these promising applications stumbles upon a fundamental impediment: the prevailing cloud data management technologies are often hosted on remote data centers. This architectural choice introduces daunting challenges, including substantial wide-area latency, burdensome connectivity and communication bandwidth demands, and regulatory constraints related to personal and sensitive data.

This talk presents our research in introducing edge-cloud data management that provides a framework for managing data across edge nodes to overcome the limits of cloud-only data management. We encounter various challenges to achieving this vision such as managing the sheer amount of edge nodes, their sporadic availability, and device constraints in terms of compute, storage, and trust. To navigate these multifaceted challenges, our work redesigns distributed data management technologies to adapt to the edge environment. This includes introducing design concepts in the domains of hierarchical and asymmetric edge-cloud data management, decentralized edge coordination techniques, and edge-friendly mechanisms to maintain security and trust. The talk includes a demonstration of 'AnyLog'–an edge-cloud data management solution that integrates our research findings.

<p><strong>Title</strong>:
    I'm SO Glad I'm Uncoordinated!
</p>

<p><strong>Abstract</strong>:
In my 44 years building software, technology trends have dramatically changed what's difficult and what's hard. In 1978, CPU, storage, and memory were precious and expensive but coordinating across work was effectively free. Running on a single server, networking was infinitely expensive as we had none. Now, there's an abundance of computation, memory, storage, and network with even more on the way! The only challenge is coordination. Year after year, the cost of coordinating gets larger in terms of instruction opportunities lost while waiting. The first half of the talk explains these changes and their impact on our systems. In response, there are many approaches to avoiding or minimizing the pain of coordination. We taxonomize these solutions and discuss how our systems are evolving and likely to evolve as the world changes around us. I am, indeed, a person who's uncoordinated and very likely to drop and/or break stuff. I've adapted to that in my personal life and spend a great deal of my professional life looking for ways our systems can avoid the need to coordinate.
</p>

<p><strong>Bio</strong>:
Pat Helland has been building distributed systems, database systems, high-performance messaging systems, and multiprocessors since 1978, shortly after dropping out of UC Irvine without a bachelor's degree. That hasn't stopped him from having a passion for academics and publication. From 1982 to 1990, Pat was the chief architect for TMF (Transaction Monitoring Facility), the transaction logging and recovery systems for NonStop SQL, a message-based fault-tolerant system providing high-availability solutions for business critical solutions. In 1991, he moved to HaL Computers where he was chief architect for the Mercury Interconnect Architecture, a cache-coherent non-uniform memory architecture multiprocessor. In 1994, Pat moved to Microsoft to help the company develop a business providing enterprise software solutions. He was chief architect for MTS (Microsoft Transaction Server) and DTC (Distributed Transaction Coordinator). Starting in 2000, Pat began the SQL Service Broker project, a high-performance transactional exactly-once in-order message processing and app execution engine built deeply into Microsoft SQL Server 2005. From 2005-2007, he worked at Amazon on scalable enterprise solutions, scale-out user facing services, integrating product catalog feeds from millions of sellers, and highly-available eventually consistent storage. From 2007 to 2011, Pat was back at Microsoft working on a number of projects including Structured Streams in Cosmos. Structured streams kept metadata within the "big data" streams that were typically 10s of terabytes in size. This metadata allowed affinitized placement within the cluster as well as efficient joins across multiple streams. On launch, this doubled the work performed within the 250PB store. Pat also did the initial design for Baja, the distributed transaction support for a distributed event-processing engine implemented as an LSM atop structured streams providing transactional updates targeting the ingestion of "the entire web in one table" with changes visible in seconds. Starting in 2012, Pat has worked at Salesforce on database technology running within cloud environments. His current interests include latency bounding of online enterprise-grade transaction systems in the face of jitter, the management of metastability in complex environments, and zero-downtime upgrades to databases and stateful applications. In his spare time, Pat regularly writes for ACM Queue, Communications of the ACM, and various conferences. He has been deeply involved in the organization of the HPTS (High Performance Transactions Systems - www.hpts.ws) workshop since 1985. His blog is at pathelland.substack.com and he parsimoniously tweets with the handle @pathelland.

<p><strong>Title</strong>:
    Dataset Search for Data Discovery, Augmentation, and Explanation
</p>

<p><strong>Abstract</strong>:
Recent years have seen an explosion in our ability to collect and catalog immense amounts of data about our environment, society, and populace. Moreover, with the push towards transparency and open data, scientists, governments, and organizations are increasingly making structured data available on the Web and in various repositories and data lakes. Combined with advances in analytics and machine learning, the availability of such data should in theory allow us to make progress on many of our most important scientific and societal questions. However, this opportunity is often missed due to a central technical barrier: it is currently nearly impossible for domain experts to weed through the vast amount of available information to discover datasets that are needed for their specific application. While search engines have addressed the discovery problem for Web documents, there are many new challenges involved in supporting the discovery of structured data---from crawling the Web in search of datasets, to the need for dataset-oriented queries and new strategies to rank and display results. I will discuss these challenges and  present our recent work in this area. In particular, I will introduce a new class of data-relationship queries that, given a dataset,  identifies related datasets; I will describe a collection of methods that efficiently support different kinds of relationships that can be used for data explanation and augmentation; and I will demonstrate Auctus, an open-source dataset search engine that we have developed at the NYU VIDA Center.

<p><strong>Title</strong>:
    When Do We Need Casual Inference in Data Science?
</p>

<p><strong>Abstract</strong>:
The most common applications of causal inference to business decision-making are in two main areas: product experiments which inform launch decisions and algorithmic policies based on machine learning models. These applications focus on the special case where interventions are relatively cheap. However, practical analytics tasks encountered by many data scientists and analysts (where interventions are usually not possible) are currently underserved by causal inference. I review the tasks we tend to encounter in practice, discuss how the causal inference lens can change the results, and speculate about the barriers to adoption of these ideas in organizations.

<p><strong>Title</strong>:
    Improving Human-Machine Partnership Through Observational Learning
</p>

<p><strong>Abstract</strong>:
There is a fast-growing interest in analyzing user interaction to create adaptive systems that can assist or collaborate on data analysis. However, the first step for an intelligent visualization response is understanding the user. Dr. Ottley’s work uses an observational learning framework, akin to humans learning concepts like language and behavior naturally through observations, often with no explicit feedback. The goal is to enable computers to infer user attributes and strategies by observing their interactions with a system. In this talk, Dr. Ottley summarizes her lab's work on user modeling for data visualization and gives a snapshot of the current research achievements and what is possible in the near and distant future. Then, she presents techniques for capturing and predicting user behavior, focusing on inferring attention, personality, biases, and knowledge by analyzing log data. Finally, Dr. Ottley highlights the significant roadblocks and future directions for visualization research.

<p><strong>Title</strong>:
   Modeling the Data-Generating Process is Necessary for Out-of-Distribution Generalization
</p>

<p><strong>Abstract</strong>:
At Microsoft Research, we are working to broaden the usage of causal AI, especially for decision-making applications, through both fundamental research and practical tooling.  In this talk, I'll briefly introduce the PyWhy open-source tools and ecosystem and the fundamental research challenges we are prioritizing based on our experiences with causal AI: better elicitation of the domain knowledge and causal assumptions necessary for a valid causal analysis; the need for better validation and trustworthiness of causal analyses; and the extension of causal analysis methods to support analysis over high-dimensional, unstructured data, such as images and text.

I'll spend the bulk of the talk deep-diving into our recent research towards the latter <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.07837">topic</a>, connecting causal graphs and the statistical independences they encode with the loss functions and constraints imposed by invariant representation learning approaches for domain generalization. Based on the causal relationships between spurious attributes and the classification label, we obtain realizations of the canonical causal graph that characterize common distribution shifts and show that each shift entails different independence constraints over observed variables. This work explains why no single current method performs consistently across all kinds of distribution shifts, and leads to a new algorithm, Causally Adaptive Constraint Minimization (CACM), that adaptively identifies and applies the correct independence constraint for regularization.  Extensive experiments show that adaptive dataset-dependent constraints lead to the highest accuracy on unseen domains, demonstrating the criticality of modeling the causal relationships inherent in the data-generating process.

   Toward Interpretable and Actionable Data Analysis with Query Debugging and Causal Inference
</p>

<p><strong>Abstract</strong>:
In today’s data-driven world, users in different fields routinely collect, study, and make decisions supported by data. This motivates development of new techniques to help users from various backgrounds and levels of expertise process data, extract useful information and insights from data, and subsequently make sound decisions. In this talk, I will describe some of our work toward interpretable and actionable data analysis focusing on two steps of the data analysis pipeline. First, I will discuss generating explanations to help new programmers and students debug wrong queries and write correct relational queries. Then, I will talk about our research on connecting data management research with causal inference research to enable causal analysis and hypothetical reasoning for large complex data, and conclude with future research directions.

<p><strong>Title</strong>:
   Blame the data, not the system: how data constraints can help in trustworthy machine learning and explain causes of data-system malfunction.
</p>

<p><strong>Abstract</strong>:
The core of modern data-driven systems comprises models learned from large datasets, and they are usually optimized to target particular data and workloads. While these data-driven systems have seen wide adoption and success, their reliability and proper function hinge on the data's continued conformance to the systems initial settings and assumptions. My research focuses on designing mechanisms to assess the trustworthiness of a system's inferences and explain causes of system malfunction due to data nonconformance. The key idea here is that since data is central to data-driven systems, it can guide us to determine whether predictions made by an ML model can be trusted, and to expose the cause of a system's unexpected behavior. In this talk, I will talk about mechanisms and explanation frameworks to facilitate trusting and understanding outcomes involving data and data systems.
</p>

<p><strong>Bio</strong>:
I am a Researcher at Microsoft. I obtained my Ph.D. from the University of Massachusetts, Amherst under the supervision of Alexandra Meliou. My primary area of research revolves around data management; but, the application areas of my research have been interdisciplinary, spanning from program synthesis and software engineering to machine learning, natural language processing, and human-computer interaction. I am interested in designing mechanisms for enhancing system usability, by developing intelligent tools towards boosting end-user productivity, and developing mechanisms for explaining system behavior ranging from traditional systems to opaque, data-driven systems.

<p><strong>Title</strong>:
   Towards Instance-Optimized Data Systems
</p>

<p><strong>Abstract</strong>:
Recently, there has been a lot of excitement around ML-enhanced (or learned) algorithm and data structures. For example, there has been work on applying machine learning to improve query optimization, indexing, storage layouts, scheduling, log-structured merge trees, sorting, compression, sketches, among many other things. Arguably, the motivation behind these techniques are similar: machine learning is used to model the data and/or workload in order to derive a more efficient algorithm or data structure. Ultimately, what these techniques will allow us to build are “instance-optimized” systems; systems that self-adjust to a given workload and data distribution to provide unprecedented performance and avoid the need for tuning by an administrator.
In this talk, I will provide an overview of the opportunities and limitations of learned index structures, storage layouts, and query optimization techniques we have been developing in my group, and how we are integrating these techniques to build a first instance-optimized database system.

<p><strong>Title</strong>:
    CrocodileDB: Resource Efficient Database Execution
</p>

<p><strong>Abstract</strong>:
The coming end of Moore’s law requires that data systems be more judicious with computation and resources as the growth in data outpaces the availability of computational resources. Current database systems are eager and aggressively consume resources to immediately and quickly complete the task at hand. Intelligently deferring a task to a later point in time can increase result reuse, reduce work that might later be invalidated, or avoid unnecessary work altogether. In this talk I will introduce CrocodileDB, a resource-efficient database system that automatically optimizes deferment based on user-specification and workload prediction. CrocodileDB integrates new ways of specifying timing information, new query execution policies, new task schedulers, and new data loading schemes. In particular, this talk will highlight two new query execution paradigms, Intermittent Query Processing and Incremental-Aware Query Execution.
